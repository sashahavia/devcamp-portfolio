<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, there. I am currently a senior enrolled in Brooklyn College majoring in Computer Science and anticipate graduating in Spring 2018. </p>
<hr>
<p>My coursework has exposed me to an extensive set of programming expertise. Some of the projects Iâ€™ve completed include having written a simulation of an Operating System in Java, a Bank simulation and a warehouse order tracking system in C++. I am also currently working on a project for Brooklyn College Office of Scholarships to help them automate some of the processes that are currently done manually. One of these processes is to allow them to upload an excel file through a webpage link and output a detailed report on the screen with how many entries were matched with the existing database and how many and which ones were new records.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic coursework, my work experiences have taught me the knowledge and skills needed to be a full-stack developer. I have been working fulltime while attending college and gained experience in customer service, data entry and managing inventories. In addition, I have been developing websites for local businesses as a freelancer. I have also completed a 16-week course at the New York Code and Design Academy to expand my skill set in Front-End development. Currently, I am also learning application development. I have an idea for an app for a non-profit organization that I am building in my spare time.</p>
