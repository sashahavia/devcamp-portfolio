        <p>Iâ€™ve loved computers ever since I built my first computer from scratch.  I was still far away from understanding the capability of computers at that time and ignored that passion. Ever since I wrote my first animation using Actionscript I was determined to learn to code and that old passion rekindled something in me. That is why, I decided to join a Computer Science program and recently graduated cum laude from Brooklyn College. However, I realized I was missing some required skills not offered during my studies at BC. That is why, I have decided to join the Grace Hopper program at Fullstack Academy. As I am about to graduate from Fullstack Academy, I am looking for a full-time position as a Full-Stack engineer.</p>
