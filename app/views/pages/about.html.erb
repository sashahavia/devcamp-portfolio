        <p>Hi, there. My name is Sasha. I have recently graduated from Brooklyn College with major in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>I have been a fan of computers ever since I built a computer from scratch. Despite that, I was still intimidated of computers at that time and ignored that passion. Ever since I wrote my first animation using Action Script I was determined to learn to code. That is why, I decided to join Computer Science program at Brooklyn College. 
        My coursework has exposed me to an extensive set of programming expertise. Some of the projects Iâ€™ve completed include having written a simulation of an Operating System, a Bank simulation and a Stock Quote Dynamic Application in Java. In addition to my academic coursework, I have been developing websites for local businesses as a freelancer. I have also completed a 16-week course at the New York Code and Design Academy to expand my skill set in Front-End development. I have attended CUNYCodes during my last semester in college where I developed a web application in a team of seven using Agile development environment.</p>

        <p>However, as I was approaching my graduation I realized that I was missing practical skills that are required in tech field. That is why, I have decided to join Grace Hopper program at Fullstack Academy. As I am about to graduate from Fullstack Academy, I am looking for a full-time position as a Full-Stack engineer.</p>
