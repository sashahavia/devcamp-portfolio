        <p>Hi, there. I am a senior in Brooklyn College majoring in Computer Science and anticipate graduating in Spring 2018. </p>

        <p>My coursework has exposed me to an extensive set of programming expertise. Some of the projects Iâ€™ve completed include having written a simulation of an Operating System, a Bank simulation and a Stock Quote Dynamic Application in Java. I also worked on a project for Brooklyn College Office of Scholarships to help them automate some of the processes that were done manually. One of these processes was to allow them to upload an excel file through a webpage link and output a detailed report on the screen with how many entries were matched with the existing database and how many and which ones were new records. </p>

        <p>In addition to my academic coursework, my work experiences have taught me the knowledge and skills needed to be a full-stack developer. I have been developing websites for local businesses as a freelancer. I have also completed a 16-week course at the New York Code and Design Academy to expand my skill set in Front-End development. Currently, I am also learning application development. I have an idea for an app for a non-profit organization that I am building in my spare time.</p>
